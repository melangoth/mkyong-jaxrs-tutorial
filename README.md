# mkyong-jaxrs-tutorial

I am going to go through this tutorial:
http://www.mkyong.com/tutorials/jax-rs-tutorials/

I strongly recommend you to visit http://www.mkyong.com!
By the way I am not realated by any means with that page, I just frequently end up there anytime I search for a good tutorial.

The way I do this tutorial: I do not deal with the provided sources, I implement them by my self, reading the tutorial, selecting the parts I am really interested in. Sometimes I implement them with minor modifications, or ignore some parts.
